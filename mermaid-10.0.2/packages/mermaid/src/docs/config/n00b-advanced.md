# Advanced n00b mermaid (Coming soon..)

## splitting mermaid code from html

A more condensed html code can be achieved by embedding the mermaid code in its own .js file, which is referenced like so:

```html
...
  </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The actual mermaid file could for example look like this:

```javascript
mermaid content ...
```

## mermaid configuration options

```markdown
(coming soon)
```
